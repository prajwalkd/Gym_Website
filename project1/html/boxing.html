              <p>[2:38 PM, 12/16/2021] My Jio New: Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usu
                  ally wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and 
                  mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
                [2:39 PM, 12/16/2021] My Jio New: Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth 
                Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international gamesâ€”it also has its own Worl
                 Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds.
                
                A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a 
                referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or r

                 In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges a
                 ward the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.
                
                While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since
                 the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting 
                 contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.[2] The earliest 
                 evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic 
                 game in 688 BC.[2] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain,
                  to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the
