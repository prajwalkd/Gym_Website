              <p>weightlifting is already tough enough without adding a devastating injury to the plate of any competitor or amateur.  It is blaringly obvious that weightlifting has the potential to be a dangerous sport, participants are not only required to lift enormous weight over their head, but they are also expected to do it without hurting themselves.

                A weightlifting injury can happen to almost any area of the body or muscle group.  The majority of injuries can happen in the form of sprains, strains, or tendon avulsions, and are largely associated with lifting too much weight too quickly or not warming up and stretching properly.
                
                This section is designed with the weightlifter, regardless of experience level, in mind.  We know injuries can happen to the experts as easily as they can happen to the beginners, and we want to make sure you not only stay healthy but that you stay safe.
                
                After all, "pumping some iron" requires much more than an Austrian accent and a speedo.the sport or activity of lifting barbells or other heavy weights. There are two standard lifts in modern weightlifting: the single-movement lift from floor to extended position (the snatch ), and the two-movement lift from floor to shoulder position,
                 and from shoulders to extended position (the clean and jerk ).
