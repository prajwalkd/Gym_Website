              <p>A personal trainer is an individual who has earned a certification that demonstrates 
                  they have achieved a level of competency for creating and delivering safe and effective 
                  exercise programs for apparently healthy individuals and groups or those with medical clearance
                   to exercise. They motivate clients by collaborating to set goals, providing meaningful feedback, 
                   and by being a reliable source for accountability. Trainers also conduct a variety of assessments
                    beginning with a preparticipation health-screening and may also include assessments of posture
                     and movement, flexibility, balance, core function, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness,
                      body composition, and skill-related parameters (e.g., power, agility, coordination, speed, and
                       reactivity) to observe and gather relevant information needed to develop an effective exercise 
                       program and support client goal attainment. These assessments may be performed at the beginning 
                       of and after an exercise program to measure client progress toward improved physical fitness.
                        They also provide education on many other aspects of wellness, including general health and 
                        nutrition guidelines. Helping clients to reach their full potential in various aspects of life requires
                   a comprehensive client-centered approach along with a belief that clients are resourceful and capable of change.
